## 🧹 Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production-ready development, it's recommended to use **TypeScript** with **type-aware ESLint rules**.

To get started:
- Add `typescript`
- Add [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io)

Check out the [official TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to see how to set it up.
